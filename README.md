This is another project I am completing while following the Udemy course "Gatsby V3 Tutorial and Projects Course" by John Smilga. Topics handled inside the code are:
 - Airtable as headless CMS
 - Gatsby plugin image (StaticImage and GatsbyImage components)
 - Gatsby source filesystem
 - Graphql (Static query and Page query)
 - Env variables
 - Gatsby plugin styled components
 - Algolia
 - Airtable.js
 
Interesting aspects of this projects have been:
- Setting up a dynamic survey using airtable.js npm package that allows retrieving data from airtable and then updating them at run-time.
